          I continuously contributed to ideating and developing new features
          alongside the UX team and my senior frontend colleague. This involved
          researching the best libraries (date-fns, slate.js, etc) and
          documenting technical decisions and reasoning in Confluence.

          I built new components using Styled Components and TypeScript, which
          were added to the Storybook-based component library. Some components
          were customized from the Carbon UI library.

          I worked extensively with the UI, gaining a strong understanding of
          Flexbox, Grid, and CSS in general. I also connected frontend
          components to backend services, integrating dynamic data from FastAPI
          endpoints for operations like adding, editing, and deleting data,
          ensuring smooth communication between the frontend and backend
          systems. <br />
          Additionally, I fetched data and managed state using React hooks like
          useState, useRef, useContext and costum hooks.

          I also gained experience working with Git in a collaborative
          repository, handling contributions from multiple team members. Task
          management was done via Jira, and daily and weekly planning meetings
          ensured the team remained synchronized and focused.
